# Accessibility

I strive to make course materials accessible. That said, some slides include complex diagrams that may remain hard to follow even with detailed alt text. If you need assistance, please contact me as early in the semester as possible so I can provide appropriate alternatives.

Feel free to speak with me within the add–drop period to request other accommodations as well. Note that emailing an SDS letter to me alone is not sufficient and does not automatically grant assignment extensions.
