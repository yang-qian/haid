# Attendance

# Homeworks

All homework submissions must be typed and submitted to Gradescope by 11:59 pm Pacific Time on the due date. As a rule of thumb, we will not be accepting or grading any handwritten submissions (however, for the first homework, we will be lenient and accept handwritten submissions by deducting 5%). After the first homework, we will NOT be accepting or grading any handwritten submissions so please make sure you plan accordingly (there will be no exceptions to this policy starting from homework 2). We highly recommend using LaTeX, and we will be posting the LaTeX source code of the homework assignments so you can borrow the LaTeX code from the problem statements. Homeworks 1-3 will be individual submissions, which means that students should type up their own homework. From homework 4 onwards, paired submissions are permitted, so students can make a single submission for groups of size up to 2.

## Late Day Policy
You will have a total of 6 late days to use on homework assignments with a maximum of 2 late days on a single assignment. Each late day can be treated as a 24-hr extension; e.g., if the assignment is due Wednesday at 11:59 pm Pacific Time, you may hand it in by Thursday at 11:59 pm and use one late day, or by Friday at 11:59 pm and use two late days. You are responsible for keeping track of your late days. No credit will be given for homework turned in after 48 hours past the due date, or for late homework after all late days have been used.

## Regrade Policy

You may submit a regrade request for homework through this link. Please include a thorough description of the error that the grader made. You must submit a regrade request within 1 week of receiving your grade, by end of day (i.e. 11:59 pm). Some notes:

We reserve the right to regrade the entire assignment on a regrade request. This means you may lose more points on other problems if we discover grading errors in the other direction.
Your regrade request will go to the TA who graded your work originally and the instructor.
Legitimate regrade requests include:
- The points were not added correctly.
- The comments say I’m missing part (c), but it was actually on a different page.
- The comments say that my algorithm is incorrect with this particular case, but I implemented my algorithm and it does work in that case.

Illegitimate regrade requests include:
- I disagree with the rubric; I should have gotten more partial credit for my solution.
- I understand that my solution wasn’t clear, but what I meant to say was correct.
