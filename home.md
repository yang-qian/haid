# Course Introduction
<!-- Course Description -->
Welcome to INFO4940/5940 SEC10 Design AI Products and Services, 2026 spring edition.
<!-- Future: add 6940, update course name. -->

<!-- [95% of generative AI adoption efforts fail.](https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf) -->


## Learning Goals
This course equips future creators of AI products and services with the knowledge and skills necessary to maximize AI's societal benefits while minimizing its risks and harms. Through a series of hands-on projects and thought-provoking discussions, students will develop the ability to:
 
- **Identify** the sociotechnical ecosystem surrounding a specific AI system.
- **Explain** key concepts that underpin “good” human-AI interaction, such as collaboration, coordination, explainability, intelligibility, trustworthiness, trust, and fairness.
- **Collaborate** in interdisciplinary teams to **apply** these concepts in **designing** AI systems that are both valuable and empowering collaborators for their direct users, while also benefiting society and being resilient to bias and manipulation.


## Prerequisite
Students must meet at least one of the following criteria before enrolling in this course.
* <b>Human-centered design background:</b> Completion of INFO3450, INFO4240, or equivalent courses, or relevant industry experience;
* <b>AI background:</b> Completion of CS3700, CS3780, ECE4200, ORIE3741, STSCI3740, or an equivalent AI course
<!-- * 6940/research session: Research experience in HCI, AI, or other applied AI fields -->

## Course Structure
- This course meets once a week for a 3-hour session on Fridays. Each session begins with a lecture that includes open-floor discussions, followed by a 10-minute break and then group activities.
- The lectures teach foundational knowledge about human-centered AI, and students will practice applying this knowledge and making concrete AI design decisions (e.g., training data, model choice, and interaction design) through three [group projects](assignments.md). Weekly in-class activities and assignments will prepare students for these projects.
- Homework is due every Wednesday 8:30 am, 48 hours before class starts.
