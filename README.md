### Learning Goals
- Identify the stakeholder groups involved with an AI system;
- Understand key concepts that underpin "good" human-AI interaction, such as explainability, intelligibility, fairness, human-AI collaboration, and trust;
- Apply these concepts to design AI systems that are useful, trustworthy, trusted, and resilient to bias and manipulation

### Course Structure
